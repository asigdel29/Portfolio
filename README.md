I've designed this portfolio to provide an immersive terminal emulator experience. The interactive terminal-like interface allows you to navigate through my work and discover my projects with ease. Feel free to use the provided commands to explore my portfolio and learn more about my journey as a developer.

### Matrix Rain

One of the standout features of this portfolio is the Matrix Rain background. Inspired by the iconic "falling code" effect from the movie "The Matrix," I've integrated this mesmerizing JavaScript animation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The Matrix Rain adds an extra layer of immersion and nostalgia to your journey through my projects.

### Portfolio Pages

Here's a quick overview of the different sections you'll find in my portfolio:

- **Home**: The main landing page provides an introduction to my portfolio and highlights my key skills and areas of expertise.

- **Projects**: The Projects page showcases various web development and software projects I've worked on. You can interact with the projects using the terminal emulator, just like a real developer.

- **About**: The About page provides a brief overview of my background, skills, and interests, giving you a glimpse into who I am beyond the code.

- **Research**: The Research page highlights my academic and research work, including publications and projects that demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning.
