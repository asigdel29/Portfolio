One of the standout features of this portfolio is the Matrix Rain background. Inspired by the iconic "falling code" effect from the movie "The Matrix," I've integrated this mesmerizing JavaScript animation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The Matrix Rain adds an extra layer of immersion and nostalgia to your journey through my projects.
