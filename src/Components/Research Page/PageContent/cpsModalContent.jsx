<p>As a researcher at the Cyber Physical Systems Lab SUNY Oswego, I developed a Collaborative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) simulation...</p>
<p>The simulation is divided into three phases to simulate Collaborative Adaptive Cruise Control behavior:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Phase 1: Initiate</li>
  <li>Phase 2: Sensing and Control</li>
  <li>Phase 3: Negotiation</li>
</ol>
<p>I also attached a Logitech steering wheel to simulate "autonomous" driving by mimicking cars in the simulation.</p>
<p>For further information about this project, you can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/tenbergen/Urban-CPS" style="color: #00FF00; text-decoration: underline;">GitHub</a>.</p>
