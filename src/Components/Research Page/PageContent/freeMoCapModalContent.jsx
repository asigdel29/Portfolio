<p>As a research assistant for the Cognitive Dynamics Lab at SUNY Oswego, I played a key role in developing a high-precision markerless motion capture program...</p>
<p>I worked at the Cognitive Dynamics Lab, SUNY Oswego, from August 2021 to May 2023.</p>
<ul>
  <li>My primary responsibility was to enhance the precision of motion capture for research purposes. To achieve this, I engineered a markerless motion capture program using OpenPose and DeepLabCu. This program achieved an impressive calibration accuracy of 99.3% when using Charuco Boards. This precision ensured near-perfect capture of motion data for our research studies.</li>
  <li>In addition to developing the motion capture program, I played a critical role in data collection. Participants in our research completed a series of Fitts Chopsticks Tasks in three different settings. These tasks involved moving objects back and forth between specific areas to measure tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. Participants performed the tasks with their fingers and with chopsticks, and then repeated both tasks while blindfolded.</li>
