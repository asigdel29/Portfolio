description: Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Early detection and appropriate treatment can prevent vision loss, making it crucial to have effective detection systems in place.\n\n
To address this, I utilized machine learning, specifically leveraging the EfficientNet architecture, known for its efficiency and high performance in image classification tasks. Using a convolutional neural network based on the EfficientNet model, I designed a system tailored to accurately detect signs of diabetic retinopathy from high-resolution retina images, even those taken under varied imaging conditions. After extensive training on a comprehensive dataset, the model yielded an accuracy rate of 87%.\n\n
To enhance the performance metrics further, I implemented an image preprocessing algorithm based on Quadratic Weighted Kappa. This enhancement improved the model's accuracy from an initial 79% and concurrently reduced the training duration by a notable hour. This endeavor embodies my ability to design, implement, and refine state-of-the-art machine learning solutions for critical medical challenges.\n\n
