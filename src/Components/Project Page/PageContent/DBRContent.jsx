description:Using a convolutional neural network model, I engineered a system that can analyze high-resolution retina images taken under varying imaging conditions to accurately predict the presence of diabetic retinopathy. Through extensive training on a large and diverse dataset, the model achieved an exceptional accuracy rate of 87%.\n +
To further optimize the system's performance, I implemented an algorithm for image preprocessing which not only increased the accuracy from 79% but also reduced the training time by one hour. This showcases my ability to not only design but also optimize a system to achieve high-performance standards.,
