<p>The Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) Tool is the result of an intensive software design project tailored to streamline the peer review process in academic settings. A calibrated peer review is a method wherein an instructor devises an assignment, assigns it to students, evaluates their solutions, disseminates the solution to peers for review, and conducts quality assurance on each review before determining the final grade.</p>

<p>Our software design team harnessed an agile development methodology, culminating in an anonymous peer review platform. This innovation curtailed biases and heightened the dependability of the reviews.</p>

<p>The development was executed under the umbrella of a SUNY Oswego software design team, coupled with the continuous guidance from IBM, who played the role of pivotal stakeholders throughout the project's journey. The harmonious collaboration with IBM enabled the assimilation of valuable feedback and insights into the design, ensuring the application aptly catered to the requisites of both educators and students. The project also saw the extensive employment of IBM's state-of-the-art technology, resulting in a robust and scalable solution.</p>
