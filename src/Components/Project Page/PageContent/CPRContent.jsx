<p>The CPR Tool is the product of a software design project that functions to faclitate the peer review process in an academic setting. 
A calibrated peer review refers to the process in which an instructor creates and assignment, distributes the assignment to be completed 
by students, reviews their solutions, disperses the solution to other students for peer review, and then quality checks each review before assigning a a final grade.</p>

<p>The software design team utilized an agile development methodology to create an anonymous peer review platform, which reduced biases and increased the reliability of reviews.</p> 

<p>The development of the CPR Tool was carried out by a SUNY Oswego software design team with oversight from IBM, who acted as stakeholders throughout the project.
The Oswego team worked closely with IBM to incorporate their feedback and suggestions into the design of the application, ensuring it met the needs of both students and instructors alike.
In addition, the development team utilized IBM technology throughout the project to create a powerful and scalable platform.</p>
